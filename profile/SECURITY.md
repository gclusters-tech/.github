If you discover a security issue, disclose it privately to support@gclusters.tech or write a private security advisory on GitHub.

We will triage and respond thus:
- Respond within 48 hours that we have received the report.
- Triage severity and designate a maintainer.
- Provide a fix and coordinated disclosure timeline.

Do not provide public issue trackers for security bugs.
